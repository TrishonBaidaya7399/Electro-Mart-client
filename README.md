# Project Description
- This project is based on Technology and Electronics.
- In this web application, we have 6 different types of Brand products.
- While clicking on each brand, the website redirects to a specific brands page, where it shows products related to this Brand only.
- If a user is not logged in, he/she can't access webpages other than only Home page. If he or she tries to navigate to a page without logging in, they will be automatically redirected to the login page and ask for login.
- While they log in, they will be automatically redirected to the desired web page.
- Here we have implemented a Strong password validation system and also show errors in it.
- You can add products to the cart and access the added products from the cart page at the navbar.
- If user want, he/she can remove cart item from the cart

That's all about my project.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
